-------------------------------------------------------------

The **bsub** package is only broadly tested on DKFZ ODCF cluster and the
default configurations work fine there. It is also possible for other clusters
that use LSF system to use **bsub** package. The following global options should
be properly configured.

If you have difficulties to configure **bsub** package for your cluster, please
feel free to contact me. I am glad to help.

### How to call Rscript command

You need to configure how to call the `Rscript` command, especially when you
have different versions of R installed. Following is how we call `Rscript` on
our cluster (we use `module` to manage the bash environment).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bsub_opt$call_Rscript = function(version) {
	qq("module load gcc/7.2.0; module load java/1.8.0_131; module load R/@{version}; Rscript")
}
```

Then the different version of `Rscript` can be switched by setting different
`bsub_opt$R_version` option (The value of `bsub_opt$R_version` will be passed 
to the `call_Rscript()` function.

Similarlly, if you use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) for managing
different versions of software, you can also choose R with different versions
by setting a proper `bsub_opt$call_Rscript`. Let assume you have conda
environments for different R versions with the naming schema `R_$version` (e.g.
R_3.6.0), then you can set `bsub_opt$call_Rscript` as:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bsub_opt$call_Rscript = function(version) {
    qq("conda activate R_@{version}; Rscript")
}
```

### Submission node

The names of the nodes where the jobs are submitted can be set by
`bsub_opt$submission_node` option. The value can be a vector of node names.
**bsub** will randomly select one to connect.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bsub_opt$submission_node = ...
```

### Login node

If you want to submit jobs, the login node should be the same as the
submission node. By default, the value for `login_node` is automatically
copied from `submission_node`. But there are cases when the login node is
different from the submission node. For example, If you are working on your
own laptop, to connect to your institute's cluster, you need to first connect
to server A to enter your institute's network, then on server A, you continue
to connect to server B which is the submission node. In this case, server A is
the login node. When you explicitly set `login_node`, you should also set
`submission_node` to `NULL` because in this circumstance, you cannot submit
jobs:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bsub_opt$login_node = "server A"
bsub_opt$submission_node = NULL
```

You can still query job status. Please refer to [two_ssh.html](two_ssh.html) to
see the instructions of how to configure **bsub** packages when you need
to establish two connections to the submission node.

### Username on the submission node

Your username on the submission node can be set by `bsub_opt$user`. The
default value is `Sys.info()['user']`. If the username on the submission node
is different, you need to explicitly set it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bsub_opt$user = ...
```

### Bash environment

`bsub_opt$ssh_envir` should be properly set so that LSF binaries such as
`bsub` or `bjobs` can be found. There are some environment variables
initialized when logging in the bash terminal while they are not initialized
with the ssh connection. Thus, some environment variables should be manually
set.

An example for `bsub_opt$ssh_envir` is as follows. The `LSF_ENVDIR` and
`LSF_SERVERDIR` should be defined and exported.
 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
bsub_opt$ssh_envir = c("source /etc/profile",
                       "export LSF_ENVDIR=/opt/lsf/conf",
                       "export LSF_SERVERDIR=/opt/lsf/10.1/linux3.10-glibc2.17-x86_64/etc")
```


The values of these two variables can be obtained by entering following
commands in your bash terminal (on the submission node):

```
echo $LSF_ENVDIR
echo $LSF_SERVERDIR
```

### bsub template

You need to define the template for calling the `bsub` command by
`bsub_opt$bsub_template` option. The self-defined function should accepts
following arguments:

- `name` job name.
- `hours` running time.
- `memory` memory, in GB.
- `cores` number of cores to use.
- `output` path of output file.
- `...` should be added as the last argument of the function.

The temporary bash script to submit is automatically appended as the last argument of `bsub`.

_E.g._, the template on our cluster is defined as:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bsub_opt$bsub_template = function(name, hours, memory, cores, output, ...) {
	glue::glue("bsub -J '{name}' -W '{hours}:00' -n {cores} -R 'rusage[mem={memory}GB]' -o '{output}'")
}
```

You can use `glue::glue()` or `GetoptLong::qq()` to construct a complex string
with interpolating multiple variables.

### How to parse the time strings

The time strings by LSF `bjobs` command might be different for different
installations. The **bsub** package needs to convert the time strings to
`POSIXlt` objects for calculating the time difference in the `bjobs()`
function. Thus, if the default time string parsing fails, users need to
provide a user-defined function and set with `bsub_opt$parse_time` option in
`bsub_opt`. The function accepts a vector of time strings and returns a
`POSIXlt` object. For example, if the time string returned from `bjobs`
command is in a form of `Dec 1 18:00:00 2019`, the parsing function can be
defined as:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bsub_opt$parse_time = function(x) {
    as.POSIXlt(x, format = "%b %d %H:%M:%S %Y")
}
```

**bsub** package automatically recognizes several formats of time strings.
