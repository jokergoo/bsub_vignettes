-------------------------------------------------------------

For us, if we are outside of DKFZ network, we first connect to DKFZ network by
VPN, then we only need one ssh connection to reach the submission node.
However, in some other institutes, if you are outside of network of your
institute, you might first need to connect to your institute's server via ssh
(server A), then on server A, you connect to the job submission server, again
via ssh (server B), which results in two ssh connections.

Of course, you cannot establish two nested ssh connections, but we can do some
tricks on server A to run a pseudo `bjobs` which actually runs the real
`bjobs` on server B. Maybe you have already guessed, we need to, on server A,
run `bjobs` on server B via ssh without interactively entering the
password.

**Note since you are not under the same network as the submission node, you cannot
submit jobs, however, you can query the job status by functions like `bjobs`,
`brecent` or `monitor()`.**

The following instructions tell you how to configure `bsub_opt` so that you
can use **bsub** package on your own computer outside your institute's network.

**Step 1:** on server A, generate an ssh key so that you can connect from server A to B
without entering password interactively.

On server A, in the shell:

```
ssh-keygen
```

Select where you store the key file (let's assume it is
`~/.ssh/id_rsa`). Copy the key to the server B:

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@serverB
```

Test whether you need to enter password if you go from server A to B:

```
ssh user@serverB
```

**Step 2:** On your own computer, use the following configuration. Note here
we set the `login_node` while not `submission_node` because the submission
node is not your login node.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
config_foo =  function(user = NULL) {
	bsub_opt$login_node = "serverA"
	bsub_opt$submission_node = NULL  # so that you cannot submit jobs!
	
	if(!is.null(user)) bsub_opt$user = user

	# You need to find out the value of `LSF_ENVDIR` and `LSF_SERVERDIR` on the submission node.
	# Check the "Bash environment" section in ./configure_bsub_package.html
	ssh_envir = "source /etc/profile; export LSF_ENVDIR=your_LSF_ENVDIR; export LSF_SERVERDIR=your_LSF_SERVERDIR"

	# We create pseudo `bjobs`/`bparam`/`bkill` which actually call the real commands on server B
	bsub_opt$ssh_envir = c(
		"source /etc/profile",
		qq("alias bjobs=\"ssh -i your_ssh_key @{bsub_opt$user}@serverB '@{ssh_envir};bjobs'\""),
		qq("alias bparam=\"ssh -i your_ssh_key @{bsub_opt$user}@serverB '@{ssh_envir};bparam'\""),
		qq("alias bkill=\"ssh -i your_ssh_key @{bsub_opt$user}@serverB '@{ssh_envir};bkill'\"")
	)
	invisible(NULL)
}
config_foo("your-user-name")
```

Now you can query job status with **bsub** package from command-line (by
`bjobs()`/`brecent()`/...) or with the interactive job monitor (by `monitor()`).
